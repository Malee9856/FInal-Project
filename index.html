                <p id="p-1"> Succulent plants, are a collection of plants that have water storage tissues.  Succulent plants are drought resistant plants. They have adapted to survive very dry, arid conditions. These plants typically store water in their leaves, their stems, or their roots.

                    The word succulent comes from the Latin word sucus, meaning juice or sap. Their leaves tend to be fleshy, plump and thick to conserve water and to help minimize water loss.</p>

                <h3 id="title-2">Where are they from? </h3>

                <p id="p-2">Succulents are found all over the world in their natural habitats. They have a wide and rich range of habitats and are often found in environments that would otherwise be uninhabited. Most come from dry areas, deserts and semi-deserts ranging from Africa to North and South America; still others are found in mountainous regions and rain forests. Conditions that are normally too harsh for other plants to survive, such as high temperatures and low precipitation have made these plants extremely hardy and adaptable. Some succulents are also naturally found in sea coasts and dry lakes, which can be detrimental to other plant species because of their extreme levels of dissolved minerals.</p>

                            <li id="li-1">Sunlight</li>
                            <p>Make sure your succulents get at least six hours of bright sunlight every day. Preferably morning sun when the sunlight is not harsh. If your succulents get enough sunlight through out the day, they will grow compacted and the colors will remain bright. If your succulents get leggy, it means they are not getting adequate sunlight. The stem will start to stretch out causing it to grow long and the leaves begin to space out.</p>
                            

                            <br>

                            <li id="li-1">Water</li>
                            <p> Succulents have the ability to store water in leaves so it is important to know when and how to water them. Only water your succulent when the soil is completely dry because they don't like having their roots constantly wet which can lead to root rot. Depending on the temperature and weather, you should water your succulent once every week or two week.</p>
                            <br>

                             <li id="li-1">Soil and Drainage </li>
                             <p>Succulents need well-draining soil compared to most plants in order to thrive. That is because they tolerate drought and store water in their leaves and stems. Well-draining soil should include at least pumice, crushed granite, or perlite. They help with drainage and doesn't retain water.The mixture typically consists of 50% peat moss, 25% perlite, and 25% coarse sand or pumice. Cactus potting mixes also have excellent properties for easy drainage without being too coarse.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p> There are two ways to propagate succulents. The first way of propagating succulent is by removing the leaves off from the stem. Slowly remove the leaves by twisting it back and forth until the entire leaves come off the stem. After taking the leaves off the stem, place each leave on top of dry soil. After several days, roots and babies will start sprouting out from the end of the leaves. 
                            
                        The second way is by taking a cutting from the actual plant. This process is faster since you are cutting off the head of the plant. Make sure to use a clean scissors to take the cutting to avoid infection. Let the cutting callus and stick the end of the stem into dry soil.
