                <p id="p-1">I have been growing succulents since 2016. I received my first succulent as a gift from a friend's wedding and was clueless about how to care for it. I placed the succulent on the windowsill and watered it daily, treating it like a houseplant. Unfortunately, it began to rot from the bottom. That's when I started conducting more research and learning about succulents.</p>
                
                <p id="p-1">I gradually gained an understanding of how to care for succulents and began acquiring more plants to experiment with. Within a year, I had over 50 succulents and started to learn how to propagate. Before long, I had over 100 succulents. During my research on different succulent varieties, I stumbled upon succulent tapestry landscaping. It became a personal hobby that I enjoy on weekends. I started purchasing more succulents and designing a small area in my backyard with them.
